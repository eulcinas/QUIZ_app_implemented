# QUIZ_app
During a course at CodeAcademy we live coded a simple quiz app using HTML, CSS and JS. 

After finishing the live code session, I was given a task to implement this quiz with these functions:

-- Add a possibility to see the question the user is currently on and how many questions are in total (e.g. 1 out of 10);

-- Add a possibility to choose a difficulty (easy - 30s for each question, medium - 20s for each question, hard - 10s for each question). Include a timer and after the time runs out, only the result is shown;

This was an interesting challenge since I had to implement a code and try to keep similar style in general.
